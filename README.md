# Consolation_Cat_News_App
A news app that feeds you articles along with a random photo of a cat to give you a serotonin boost (because the news is stressful).

# Features
Consolation Cat uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX and APIs.

Search the New York Times for articles, but receive a cat image with your news, instead of the images associated with the article.
This creates a less stressfu news reading environment.
